# Token Information Website - Favoriting Feature

This branch extends the `main` branch, enhancing the Token Information Website by adding a favoriting feature. Users can now add tokens to their favorites, view their favorited tokens, and remove them from the favorites list. The state of favorited tokens is persisted using local storage.

## Features

- **Favorite Tokens:** Allows users to add tokens to a favorites list and view them separately.
- **Local Storage Persistence:** Favorited tokens are stored in local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.
- **Optimistic UI Updates:** The UI reflects favoriting actions immediately for a smooth user experience.
- **Context API:** Manages state related to favorited tokens using React's Context API.

## Tests

- Tests were richly enhanced to cover all use cases for the user favoriting feature and helper functions used in the application.
